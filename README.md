# 🧾 Audit Report Portfolio

Welcome to my **Smart Contract Audit Report Portfolio** — a curated collection of security audit reports that showcase my journey and experience in auditing smart contracts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each audit report is stored as a PDF file in the root directory.  
Filenames follow a clear naming convention for easy browsing and sorting:

**Example:**  
`2025-10-17-passwordstore-audit.pdf`

## 📖 Viewing Reports

You can view each report directly in your browser or any standard PDF reader.
